# Lloyds Banking Group Data Science & Analytics

## Project brief

As a new data science graduate, you have been entrusted with a critical project that could significantly impact our customer retention strategies. Li, our senior data scientist, has specifically chosen you to take over this project due to your strong analytical skills and enthusiasm for solving real-world business problems. 

## Context

The project you are about to embark on is the "**_Customer Retention Enhancement through Predictive Analytics_**" initiative. This project arose from an urgent need to address declining retention rates within certain segments of our customer base. Over the past few months, we've noticed a worrying trend of increased customer churn, particularly among young professionals and small business owners. This poses a substantial threat to our market position and long-term profitability.

Our fictional client, SmartBank, a subsidiary of Lloyds, has reported that a substantial portion of their customer base is at risk of moving to competitors offering more personalised banking solutions. SmartBank has tasked our team with developing **a predictive model** to _identify at-risk customers and propose targeted interventions to retain them_.
